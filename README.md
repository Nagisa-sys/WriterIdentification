# Writer Identification/face recognition

Research on the topic of writer identification using unsupervised learning techniques (details in the report).
Given an image of handwritten text and labeled reference images, the writer is determined with three different approaches.
Finally, we serve the architecture as interactive Jupyter Notebooks and also as a web service via a web API that also is capable to do face recognition from pictures and videos. 

## Getting Started

The code is developed and tested using python 3.8.5.
All the packages used are in the requirements file.
Special thanks to Google for tier google colab platform (that I recommend to test the notebooks)
